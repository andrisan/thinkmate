# Paper - Zero Trust Persona

A framework paper establishing Zero Trust Persona as a foundational trust model for digital human presence.

## Central Thesis

Digital communication systems can no longer trust human appearance as evidence of identity. [[Zero Trust Persona]] provides the conceptual and architectural framework for rebuilding trust in an era of synthetic media.

---

## Core Concepts

### The Framework
- [[Zero Trust Persona]] — The complete framework definition, axioms, and principles

### Foundational Ideas
- [[Digital Appearance as Attack Surface]] — Reframing faces, voices, video as attack vectors
- [[Trust Through Verification Not Appearance]] — The paradigm shift from recognition to verification
- [[Deepfake Detection Is Insufficient]] — Why detection cannot be the primary defense

### Trust Model
- [[Continuous and Revocable Trust]] — Trust must be time-bound and always revocable
- [[Context Collapse and Trust Leakage]] — How trust fails across contexts
- [[Traditional Trust Models Failure]] — Why legacy assumptions are broken

### Threat Landscape
- [[Persona Threat Model]] — Comprehensive attack taxonomy
- [[Impersonation at Scale]] — The economics of digital impersonation

### Application
- [[ZTP Design Implications]] — How to apply ZTP to real systems
- [[ZTP Research Directions]] — Open challenges and future work

### 7. Limitations and Open Challenges
- Usability trade-offs
- Adoption barriers
- Standardization needs

### 8. Future Research
- [[ZTP Research Directions|Technical and governance directions]]

### 9. Conclusion
- Paradigm shift summary

## Key Arguments

1. **Visual trust is broken** — Generative AI has made appearance-based trust obsolete
2. **Detection is not enough** — Arms race dynamics make detection unreliable
3. **Framework over solution** — ZTP provides principles, not specific implementations
4. **Verification over recognition** — Trust must come from cryptographic/contextual signals
5. **Continuous, contextual, revocable** — Trust is never permanent or universal

---

## Contributions

1. Formal definition of Zero Trust Persona
2. Five core axioms establishing foundational assumptions
3. Five design principles translating axioms to system guidance
4. Reframing digital human appearance as a trust surface
5. Design implications for communication, social media, and access control
