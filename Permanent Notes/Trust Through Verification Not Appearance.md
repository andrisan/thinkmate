# Trust Through Verification Not Appearance

In an era where human appearance can be synthesized at will, trust must be earned through verification—not assumed through realism.

## The Shift

| Old Paradigm | New Paradigm |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Does this look real?" | "Under what conditions should this be trusted?" |
| Appearance = Identity evidence | Appearance = Untrusted input |
| One-time authentication | Continuous validation |
| Implicit trust | Explicit, contextual trust |

## Verification Over Recognition

Trust decisions should rely on:
- Cryptographic evidence
- Provenance verification
- Capture integrity
- Cross-channel context
- Temporal consistency

NOT on:
- Visual realism
- Biometric similarity
- Perceptual recognition
