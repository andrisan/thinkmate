# Digital Appearance as Attack Surface

Digital human appearance (faces, voices, video) should be treated as a potential attack surface, not a trust signal.

## Why

Generative AI enables:
- Scalable impersonation from minimal source material
- Cheap and rapid production of convincing fakes
- Adaptive attacks that evolve against detection

## The Reframe

Traditional view: Appearance → Trust signal
Zero Trust view: Appearance → Potential attack vector

This is analogous to how [[Zero Trust Persona|Zero Trust networking]] treats all network traffic as potentially hostile, regardless of origin.

## Implications

- Communication systems must decouple appearance from trust
- Media formats must support verifiable provenance
- Identity systems must assume persona compromise as baseline
