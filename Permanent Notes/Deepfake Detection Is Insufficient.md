# Deepfake Detection Is Insufficient

Detection-based approaches cannot serve as primary defense against synthetic media threats.

## Why Detection Fails

1. **Assumes appearance-based trust is valid** — It tries to preserve a broken model
2. **Adaptive attacks** — Generative systems evolve to defeat detectors
3. **Arms race** — No detection mechanism remains robust long-term
4. **False confidence** — "Verified as real" creates dangerous trust assumptions

## The Deeper Problem

Detection asks: "Is this real or fake?"

This is the wrong question. Even if detection were perfect, it still treats "real appearance" as trustworthy—which is the core assumption that's broken.

## Better Approach

Instead of detecting fakes, assume all digital personas are untrusted and require [[Trust Through Verification Not Appearance|verification through non-appearance signals]].
