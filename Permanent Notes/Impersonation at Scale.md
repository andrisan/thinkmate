# Impersonation at Scale

Digital impersonation has shifted from a high-effort, targeted attack to a cheap, scalable operation.

## Attacker Advantage

The economics have fundamentally changed:
- **Single-sample attacks** — One photo or audio clip is enough to create convincing fakes
- **Synthesis vs Verification asymmetry** — Creating fakes is cheap; verifying authenticity is expensive
- **Cross-platform reuse** — Synthesized personas can be deployed across multiple contexts
- **Automation** — Attacks can be scripted and run at scale without human intervention

## What This Means

Impersonation is no longer:
- Niche or specialized
- Requiring technical expertise
- High-effort or costly
- Limited to high-value targets

It is now a commodity capability available to any attacker.

## Implication

This asymmetry is why [[Deepfake Detection Is Insufficient|detection-centric defenses]] cannot keep up. The defender must verify everything; the attacker only needs one success.
