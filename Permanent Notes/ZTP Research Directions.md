# ZTP Research Directions

Open research challenges and future work for [[Zero Trust Persona]].

## Technical Research

### ZTP-Compliant Media Formats
- Embedding verification metadata in media
- Cryptographic binding of content to source
- Provenance chains that survive editing
- Minimal-disclosure media representations

### Trust-Aware User Interfaces
- How to display trust status without fatigue
- Graduated visual indicators
- User comprehension of trust semantics
- Balancing security and usability

### Cross-Platform Trust Propagation
- How trust transfers between systems
- Federated verification protocols
- Trust interoperability standards
- Preventing [[Context Collapse and Trust Leakage|context collapse]]

### Formal Trust Semantics
- Mathematical models for persona trust
- Proof systems for verification
- Trust composition and delegation
- Temporal trust logic

## Governance and Policy

- Legal frameworks for digital persona verification
- Liability models for trust decisions
- Privacy implications of verification
- International standards and coordination

## Adoption Challenges

- Usability vs security friction
- Incentive alignment for platforms
- Backward compatibility with existing systems
- User education and trust literacy
