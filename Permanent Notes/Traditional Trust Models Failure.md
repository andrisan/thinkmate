# Traditional Trust Models Failure

Legacy trust assumptions in digital systems are fundamentally broken by generative AI.

## Failed Assumptions

### Visual Realism as Proxy for Authenticity
- "It looks real, so it is real"
- Photorealism was once hard to fake
- Generative AI makes this trivial

### One-Time Authentication
- Verify once, trust forever
- No re-validation during session
- Assumes identity persists unchanged

### Binary Trust Decisions
- Either trusted or not trusted
- No graduated trust levels
- No context-sensitivity

### No Revocation or Decay
- Trust never expires
- No mechanism to withdraw trust
- Stale credentials remain valid

## Why This Matters

These assumptions were valid when:
- Creating realistic fake media required expertise
- Impersonation was expensive and targeted
- Digital presence was hard to forge

None of these conditions hold today.

## The Required Shift

| Legacy Model | What's Needed |
|--------------|---------------|
| Trust appearance | [[Digital Appearance as Attack Surface\|Distrust appearance]] |
| Authenticate once | [[Continuous and Revocable Trust\|Continuous validation]] |
| Binary decisions | Contextual, graduated trust |
| Permanent grants | Time-bound, revocable trust |
